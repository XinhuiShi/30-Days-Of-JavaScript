// Compare the slope of above two questions.

// Calculate the value of y (y = x2 + 6x + 9). Try to use different x values and figure out at what x value y is 0.

// Writ a script that prompt a user to enter hours and rate per hour. Calculate pay of the person?

// Enter hours: 40
// Enter rate per hour: 28
// Your weekly earning is 1120
// If the length of your name is greater than 7 say, your name is long else say your name is short.

// Compare your first name length and your family name length and you should get this output.

// let firstName = 'Asabeneh'
// let lastName = 'Yetayeh'
// Your first name, Asabeneh is longer than your family name, Yetayeh
// Declare two variables myAge and yourAge and assign them initial values and myAge and yourAge.

// let myAge = 250
// let yourAge = 25
// I am 225 years older than you.
// Using prompt get the year the user was born and if the user is 18 or above allow the user to drive if not tell the user to wait a certain amount of years.

// Enter birth year: 1995
// You are 25. You are old enough to drive

// Enter birth year: 2005
// You are 15. You will be allowed to drive after 3 years.
// Write a script that prompt the user to enter number of years. Calculate the number of seconds a person can live. Assume some one lives just hundred years

// Enter number of years you live: 100
// You lived 3153600000 seconds.
// Create a human readable time format using the Date time object

// YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm
// DD-MM-YYYY HH:mm
// DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm
