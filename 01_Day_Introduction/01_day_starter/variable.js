// Declaring different variables of different data types

let firstName = "Asabeneh"; // first name of a person
let lastName = "Yetayeh"; // last name of a person
let country = "Finland"; // country
let city = "Helsinki"; // capital city
let age = 100; // age in years
let isMarried = true;

// console.log(firstName,lastName,country,city,age,isMarried)
// Declaring variables with number values

const gravity = 9.81; // earth gravity  in m/s2
const boilingPoint = 100; // water boiling point, temperature in oC
const PI = 3.14; // geometrical constant

// console.log(gravity, boilingPoint, PI)

// Variables can also be declaring in one line separated by comma

let name = "Asabeneh", //name of a person
  job = "teacher",
  live = "Finland";

// console.log(name, job, live)


/**Variables are containers of data. 
Variables are used to store data in a memory location. 
When a variable is declared, a memory location is reserved. 
When a variable is assigned to a value (data), 
the memory space will be filled with that data. 
To declare a variable, we use var, let, or const keywords.

For a variable that changes at a different time, we use let. 
If the data does not change at all, we use const. 
For example, PI, country name, gravity do not change, and we can use const. 
We will not use var in this challenge and I don't recommend you to use it. 
It is error prone way of declaring variable it has lots of leak. 
We will talk more about var, let, and const in detail in other sections (scope). 
For now, the above explanation is enough.


A valid JavaScript variable name must follow the following rules:

A JavaScript variable name should not begin with a number.
A JavaScript variable name does not allow special characters except dollar sign and underscore.
A JavaScript variable name follows a camelCase convention.
A JavaScript variable name should not have space between words.
The following are examples of valid JavaScript variables.
